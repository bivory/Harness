## Directory Structure
- tests/
    - All the tests to run.
- results/
    - expected/
        - The expected (classified successful) results. These results are compared to future tests runs and are considered the correct output to the tests.
    - run_DATETIME/
        - The output from a test run at DATETIME. Files with the extension 'result' are the output from a test. Files with the extension 'failedresult' are the output from a test that didn't have an expected result and was classified by the user as a failed test.
